This is another simple project i've been working on these days, it's a calculator with a user-friendly interface.
If you want to enhance your knowledge of css then this is definitely the project for you to practise on.
There are alot of css properties here, so try to go through each one of them and understand them better, and feel free to add as much styling as you like, have a good day.ðŸ––
